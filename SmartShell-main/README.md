## 🚀 Project Overview

Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges in modern cities. Our project — **IoT-Based Air Quality Monitoring and Alert System** — offers a **real-time, cloud-connected**, and **sustainable** solution for monitoring air quality parameters using **ESP32**, **sensors**, and a **Firebase-powered dashboard**.

This system continuously measures environmental factors such as:

- 🌫 CO₂, CO, NO₂, PM2.5, and PM10
- 🌡 Temperature and Humidity
- 💡 Ambient Light (for solar node monitoring)

It then uploads the data to Firebase, displays live readings on a web dashboard, and triggers **instant alerts (buzzer + LED)** when dangerous levels are detected.

## 🧩 Key Features

✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** — Continuous tracking of gases and particulate matter.
🚨 **Automatic Alerts** — Instant buzzer + LED activation on crossing thresholds.
☁️ **Cloud Dashboard (Firebase + React)** — Real-time visualization, analytics, and trends.
⚡ **Solar-Powered Node** — Self-sustaining, deployable anywhere.
🧠 **AI-Ready Data** — Structured cloud data for predictive modeling.
📱 **Remote Access** — View live conditions via web or mobile integration.
💚 **Sustainable & Scalable** — Ideal for smart cities, campuses, and industries.

## 🌦 Web Dashboard (React)

### ✨ Features:

- Animated real-time cards for all sensor data
- Auto-refresh every minute (sync with ESP32)
- Synthetic variance generator for dynamic display
- Multiple charts:

  - Temperature & Humidity
  - Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10)
  - Carbon Monoxide (CO)
  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
  - CO₂ Concentration

- System health panel showing update frequency and connection status

---

## 📡 Firebase Integration

The ESP32 uploads sensor data as JSON to Firebase Realtime Database:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1730000000000,
  "temperature": 28.5,
  "humidity": 61.2,
  "co2": 875,
  "pm25": 32,
  "pm10": 48,
  "light": 720,
  "co": 3.4,
  "no2": 0.035
}
```

The frontend fetches this data via the `useAppContext` hook and visualizes it in real time.

| PM2.5 > 35 μg/m³ or PM10 > 50 μg/m³ | LED + Buzzer ON                     |
| NO₂ > 0.05 ppm or CO > 9 ppm        | Alert visualization turns red       |
| Safe levels                         | Green “Air Quality is Safe 🌿” card |
